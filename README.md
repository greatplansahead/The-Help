# The Help Website

Soooooo this is kinda a failed project. I had high hopes for this but I'm really not into it.

## The Idea

I have this idea of creating a website that collected all the resources and supports for low income families and people in Calgary. As a person that is currently in a low income household, it means alot. What I wanted to do was create a website that is really sleek. when I mean create, I mean code it all by myself, not using wix. However, I had limited web dev knowledge. I also wanted to create a really nice database searching system(whihc might've used AI) to help users get responses to their searches if their search isn't exactly the name of programs in the database. I started researching the different supports and programs and started putting them in a database. However, for the website developlment part, I started watching a youtube tutorial(the link to it is in my commits).

## The Decline
I'm not sure if it was the web dev that put me off or the pure boredom that came from watching the video. I just could'nt make myself do it.

## The Future

I will try again. I have a great idea that will help many people. 

Stay tuned
